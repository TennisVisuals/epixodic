# Epixodic

**[Live Demo](https://tennisvisuals.github.io/epixodic/)**

A browser-based match tracker for tennis and racquet sports with real-time data visualizations. Built on the [CourtHive](https://courthive.com/) ecosystem, Epixodic uses the [Competition Factory](https://courthive.github.io/competition-factory/) scoring engine and the [Scoring Visualizations](https://github.com/TennisVisuals/scoringVisualizations) charting library to capture point-by-point data and render it through interactive D3 visualizations.

All data is stored locally in the browser — no server required.

## Features

- **Point-by-point scoring** with touch-optimized portrait and landscape skins
- **Multiple match formats** — standard, No-Ad, Fast4, pro sets, college, Grand Slam variants
- **Shot decoration** — track stroke types (drive, slice, volley, lob, etc.) and shot results (winner, error, forced/unforced)
- **Real-time visualizations** that update as points are scored:
  - **Game Tree** — Sankey diagram of point progression through games (0-0 to game)
  - **GameFish** — single-game overview with score grid, serve indicators, and rally lengths
  - **Momentum Chart** — nose-to-tail GameFish across an entire match showing flow and momentum
  - **PTS Chart** — points-per-set timeline with brushing
- **Match statistics** — serve %, winners/errors, break points, and more
- **Match archive** — save, load, and manage multiple matches in browser storage
- **Import/Export** — load legacy match data or export as JSON
- **Format-aware visualizations** — Game Tree and GameFish are automatically hidden for scoring formats where they don't apply (timed sets, consecutive-point formats, team sports)
- **Responsive** — adapts between portrait (momentum chart) and landscape (PTS chart) orientations
- **Offline-capable** — runs entirely in the browser with no network dependency
